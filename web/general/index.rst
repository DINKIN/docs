The Vinli Platform
==================

The Vinli Platform allows applications to get data from Vinli devices, using a fast, simple RESTful API. Applications can get both raw and synthesized data.

For raw data:

* **Platform Service** administers your application. You can manage devices, get vehicle information, and monitor transactions.
* **Telemetry Service** delivers time-series data.
* **Event Service** offers subscriptions for vehicle events and powerful, rule- based event notifications.
* **Rule Service** creates event subscriptions based on vehicle state or georeferences.

For synthesized data:

* **Trip Service** organizes and summarizes telemetry by vehicle ignition and shutdown.
* **Diagnostic Service** allows applications to discover the malfunction state of the vehicle and provides diagnostic trouble codes.
* **Behavioral Service** categorizes driver risk based on driver behavior, vehicle conditions, and geographical travel patterns.
* **Safety Service** provides collision history and telemetry details of collisions. This service is often used together with an Event Service subscription to *collision* events.

Vinli Platform services authenticate your application and let you configure pagination. Vinli applications must authenticate themselves and their userâ€™s actions. Pagination can affect the format of dates and times.
