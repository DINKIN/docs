Safety Services
===============

The Vinli Device is able to detect when a collision occurs based on internal sensor and select vehicle telemetry data.  Using Vinli's Safety Services, your application can set up notification settings, list collision history, and retrieve detailed collision details.

The proactive features offered by the Vinli Device rely on having a Live or Complete backpack installed.  Having a cellular connection, the Vinli Device will send SMS messages to a set of phone numbers informing them of the vehicle, time, and location of the collision.  Additionally, with certain backpacks, a voice connection can be made with a single phone number to allow the driver to speak directly to one of their contacts.

Note: It is extremely important to remind the user to call their local emergency services number (9-1-1, 1-1-2, etc.).  Vinli's Safety Services, while built to be as reliable as possible, should not be used in place of standard emergency procedures.
