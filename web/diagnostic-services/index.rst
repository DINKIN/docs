Diagnostic Services
===================
In addition to transmitting real-time vehicle telemetry information, the Vinli Device interrogates the vehicle for the status of the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) or "Check Engine Light".  If the device detects that the MIL is illuminated, it requests the active diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) for the vehicle.  All of this information is sent to the Vinli Platform and can be accessed via the Diagnostic Service API.
