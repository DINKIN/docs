Safety Services
===============

The Vinli Device is able to detect when a collision occurs based on internal sensor and select vehicle telemetry data.  Using Vinli's Safety Services, your application can access collision history and retrieve detailed collision details.

Event Services can be used to set up subscriptions to `collision` events, which can be used

Note: It is extremely important to remind the user to call their local emergency services number (9-1-1, 1-1-2, etc.).  Vinli's Safety Services, while built to be as reliable as possible, should not be used in place of standard emergency procedures.
